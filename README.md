## Overview
This is my 5th Frontend Mentor Project that I have completed. This was my first time using useEffect for React and first time messing with a input range type html element.


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers

## My process
I first did the mobile version and started adding the background, along with the circle image and added the heading at the top of the app. Then I made the container at the bottom. This was my first time making an input range type html element, so I had to do some research on that and style it to the way it should look. I think had to add Javascript to changing the subscription amount and pageviews based on the input value and the discount. The states weren't changing consistently, so I had to implement useEffect to solve this. I then made the desktop version and had to make little adjustments.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

I learned how to use useEffect and learned how to style an input range type html element.




### Continued development

I want to continue getting more better with React Hooks and get even better with making frontends.
